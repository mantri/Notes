To delete a directory with large number of files:
  1. mkdir empty_dir
  2. rsync empty_dir dir_to_delete
  
  
Remove Passphrase from SSL private key (id_rsa):
  1. openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new
    (Enter passphrase for id_rsa)
  2. cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.backup
  3. mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  4. chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

  Test ssh to a machine that has your public key (id_rsa.pub) and you
  should not see any passphrase prompt.
