1. Server has all authorized clients' public keys in authorized_keys file.

2. Client connects to server and presents its public key.

3. Server sees the public key and if it is not in the authorized_keys file, does a password based authentication.

4. If client's public key is in the authorized_keys file, the server creates some random text, encrypts it with the
   client's public key and sends it to the client.

5. The client has to decrypt the random text (using its private key) and send its hash to the server.

6. If the hash is right, the server authenticates the client.
